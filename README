simpleScroll is a simple litte jQuery plugin for vertical scrolling to a specified element.

Example use:

$('#element-to-scroll-to').simpleScroll();

This will scroll the browser to be at the top of the div with the id "element-to-scroll-to".

You can also set the duration of the transition.

$('#element-to-scroll-to').simpleScroll(2000);

The duration is in milliseconds and by default it is set to 1000 (or one second).
